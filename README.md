# 🌊 Satellite Flood Risk Prediction System

An AI-based project that predicts flood risk levels using satellite location indicators, rainfall data, and river-level measurements.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Floods cause severe damage to life and infrastructure due to delayed warnings and lack of localized risk prediction.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This system analyzes:
- Satellite-based geographic location (latitude & longitude)
- Rainfall intensity
- River water level data

Using machine learning, it classifies regions into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** flood-risk zones to support early warning and disaster management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Plotly  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes rainfall, river level, and geographic coordinates collected for multiple regions over time.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Disaster management authorities  
- Early flood warning systems  
- Urban and regional planning
